# Acidizer

Acidizer is an open-source and free VST built with the JUCE Framework. Its goal is to acidize synths sounds but it can actually be used for anything you want to. It is composed of a variable state filter, you can choose either a low-pass, band-pass, high-pass or no filter at all, and a distortion module.
I made it for personnal entertainment so it is probably not going to evolve much for now.
